# **Variational Autoencoders (VAE) using Frey Face Dataset**
This repository contains code to implement Variational Autoencoders (VAE) using the Frey Face dataset and to sample points from the learned distribution by varying different latent variables to show that the network has learned meaningful latent variables.

## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you need the following dependencies:

- Python (3.x)
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- scipy
- urllib.request
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

The code was developed and tested in Google Colab, which already provides most of the required libraries. However, if you are running the code in a different environment, make sure to install the dependencies before executing the notebook.

You can install the required packages using the following command:

**pip install tensorflow keras numpy scikit-learn matplotlib**

## Documentation
The main code implementation can be found in the notebook "DL_Assign3_Ques2.ipynb." This notebook contains the Python code to implement Variational Autoencoders, load the Frey Face dataset, train the VAE model, and sample points from the learned distribution by varying different latent variables. The notebook includes comments explaining each step of the code.

## Download Dataset
The Frey Face dataset is used for training and evaluation. To run the code, you need to download the dataset and ensure it is available in the "Freyface Dataset" directory. The dataset can be downloaded from the following link: Frey Face Dataset

Data: This subdirectory contains the downloaded Frey Face dataset.
Freyface Dataset: This subdirectory should contain the "frey_rawface.mat" file.

## Implementation Details
## Variational Autoencoders (VAE)

The implementation of Variational Autoencoders is done in Python using TensorFlow and Keras libraries. The code is provided in the "DL_Assign3_Ques2.ipynb" notebook.

## The steps include:

*  Importing the required libraries.
*  Loading and preprocessing the Frey Face dataset.
*  Defining and training the Variational Autoencoder model with an embedding vector size of 20.
*  Sampling points from the learned distribution by varying different latent variables.


## Results

The following results are obtained from the implementation:
